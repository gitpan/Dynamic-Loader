NAME
    Dynamic::Loader - call a script without to know where is his location.

VERSION
    Version 0.99

SYNOPSIS
        The Dynamic::Loader manage the dynamic location of scripts and bundles. 
        Scripts and bundles are packaged in there own directory.
        The bundles and scripts locations are discribed on a named configuration file. 
        The prefix configuration directory can be specified by the $JAVAPERL environnement. 
        The default directory is $HOME/.perljava/conf, but you can specify a custom
        prefix with the $JAVAPERL/conf variable.
    
        A configuration is <name>.conf with this format:
            prefix=<absolute path>
            bin=<relative binary dir>
            lib=<relative library dir>

DEFAULT SCRIPT AND PARAMS
    When "Dynamic::Loader" is used, you can specify the script name and his
    options command: perl -S fromjar.pl scriptname.pl --a=... --b=...

   init()
    setup libs and bin directories

    #fix lib and script path according to what's given

   Dynamic::Loader::listScripts([patt])
    Return a list of commands following a pattern listScripts(),
    listScripts("*.pl"), listScripts("phe*")

    The commands returned here are returned with a relative path to the
    package they belong to

   Dynamic::Loader::getScript(relative_path)
    Return the complete path to the given scripts.

    Contrary to listScripts(), this command must return exactly one script
    and will die if not;

   Dynamic::Loader::getLibs(relative_path)
    Return the complete path to the given scripts + the complete perl prefix
    with perl5libs.

   Dynamic::Loader::getExecPrefix()
    return an array to prepend to execution (perl, includes etc...)

   Dynamic::Loader::whence([pat])
    return a list of commands with the full path corresponding to a pattern.
    Think of ls completion in bash
